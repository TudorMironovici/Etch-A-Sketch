# Etch-A-Scketch
The Etch-A-Sketch is a classic kid's toy, where the user turns two knobs to move either up/down or left/right. This is a simplistic
rendition of the Etch-A-Sketch using Python's built-in Turtle Graphics. Since this toy is very simple, the controls are as well: <br />
- ESC - quits out of the program <br />
- Space bar - clears the Etch-A-Sketch (takes a bit of moving to sketch again) <br />
- Directional Arrows - moves the Etch-a-Sketch pen in the respective directions <br />

There are also 2 variables you can change - the movement length of the Turtle pen, and the Turtle pen's width. These variables are stored
on lines 13 and 14 respectfully, and are both set to 3 by defualt.
